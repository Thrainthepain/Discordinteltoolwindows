# EVE Intel Client - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Data Format Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Client was sending `channel` field but server expected `system` field
- **Fix**: Updated client to send `system` as primary field (extracted from message or channel name)
- **Additional**: Added `systemMentions` array for multiple systems in one message

### 2. **Multiple EVE Client Handling**
- **Problem**: Client monitored ALL intel files simultaneously, causing duplicate submissions
- **Fix**: Implemented primary/standby system that monitors only the most recently active file
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic detection of active Intel channel files
  - Primary file selection based on recent activity
  - Automatic switching when primary file becomes inactive

### 3. **Intel Message Detection**
- **Problem**: No filtering for actual intel messages vs general chat
- **Fix**: Added intelligent intel detection with:
  - Keywords: red, hostile, clear, gate, cyno, etc.
  - System name pattern matching (J164738, 4O-239, M-OEE8, etc.)
  - Confidence scoring for intel quality

### 4. **Log File Handling**
- **Problem**: File monitoring was unreliable and didn't handle EVE's UTF-16LE encoding properly
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved file encoding detection
  - Better error handling for file operations
  - Enhanced file state tracking

### 5. **System Name Extraction**
- **Problem**: Server couldn't identify which systems were mentioned in intel
- **Fix**: Added regex pattern to extract EVE system names from messages
- **Patterns**: Supports J-space (J164738), null-sec (4O-239), and other formats

### 6. **Real-time vs Historical Data**
- **Problem**: Client would send old messages on startup
- **Fix**: Enhanced initial load logic that processes recent messages but doesn't submit them

## New Features Added

### Multi-Client Priority System
- Automatically detects multiple EVE clients running on same computer
- Selects most recently active Intel channel as primary
- Keeps other channels on standby for automatic failover

### Enhanced Intel Detection
```javascript
// Detects various intel patterns:
- System names: J164738, 4O-239, M-OEE8, NIDJ-K
- Intel keywords: red, hostile, clear, gate, cyno, bridge
- Confidence scoring for message quality
```

### Better Monitoring Output
```
ðŸ“‹ Found 3 Intel channel files:
   [PRIMARY] Phoenix_Intel_South_20250907_164829_2120829300.txt (45s ago, Character: 2120829300)
   [STANDBY] Phoenix_Intel_20250907_164829_2122867331.txt (120s ago, Character: 2122867331)
   [STANDBY] Test_Intel_Channel_20250908_033000_1234567890.txt (300s ago, Character: 1234567890)
```

### Enhanced API Payload
```json
{
  "system": "4O-239",
  "intel": "4O-239  FITTIpalti  Kira Frost Ohmiras  Phunas  ProTere  unterkernon",
  "pilot": "Thrain Krill",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T16:56:39.000Z",
  "channel": "Phoenix_Intel_South",
  "systemMentions": ["4O-239"],
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

## Configuration Updates

### New Config Options
```json
{
  "serverUrl": "https://intel.thrainkrill.space",
  "apiKey": "desktop-client-api-key-2024",
  "pilotName": "Thrain Krill",
  "eveLogsPath": "",
  "inactiveFileTimeout": 120000
}
```

## Testing Performed

1. âœ… Connection test passes
2. âœ… Intel file detection working
3. âœ… Real EVE log format parsing
4. âœ… System name extraction from actual intel messages
5. âœ… API format matches server expectations
6. ðŸ”„ Real-time monitoring (ready for testing)

## Next Steps

1. Test with live EVE client intel channels
2. Verify Discord webhook integration
3. Test multi-client scenario with multiple characters
4. Monitor for any duplicate message issues

## Breaking Changes

- Intel payload format changed (added `system`, `systemMentions`, `confidence`)
- File monitoring now focuses on primary file only
- Enhanced heartbeat includes more detailed stats

Server-side code should be compatible as it already handles flexible input formats.
